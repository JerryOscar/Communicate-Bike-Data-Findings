## Overview
This analysis investigates the Ford GoBike bikeshare data to uncover patterns and correlations among users. Specifically, it focuses on the relationships between a rider's age and their ride duration, compares behaviors of subscribers and customers, and examines the impact of gender on these variables.

## Dataset Summary
The dataset encompasses single-trip data within the San Francisco Bay area from 2019, detailing rental locations, durations, and user-specific information like birth year, user type, and gender.

## Data Preparation Steps
The data preparation steps involved cleaning the dataset and preparing it for analysis. Detailed steps are available in the notebook files (.ipynb) provided along with this README.md.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Age Distribution of Riders:** A histogram visualizes the age distribution, showing a majority of riders are between 24 to 40 years old, emphasizing biking as a physically active transportation mode preferred by younger demographics.

- **Average Trip Duration Across User Types and Genders:** Clustered bar charts reveal 'Customer' users have longer bike trips than 'Subscriber' users, with the 'Other' gender category showing the longest average trip durations among all.

- **User Age and Trip Duration Variations:** Violin charts provide insights into the variation in rider age and trip duration, highlighting differences based on user type, gender, and bike-sharing preferences, with 'Customer' users generally being older and having longer trips.

## Conclusions

This analysis sheds light on the bikeshare system's usage patterns, particularly the influence of age, user type, and gender on ride durations and preferences. It reveals that younger individuals predominantly use the service, with significant variations in usage patterns between subscribers and customers, as well as among different gender groups.
